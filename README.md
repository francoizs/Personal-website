# Francois Dieleman's website
Hey there!

This is my own website that I built from scratch, with mostly vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I used Bootstrap for easier css styling.
I would've liked to use React, but I haven't really figured out how to host it yet.
So that's why I didn't use it.

I chose a one-page website because I wanted to make it easy to navigate and to make it easy to find what someone was looking for.
I am planning on improving the website's design in the future. And to build a better user experience.


Thanks for looking at this repository and/or my website.
